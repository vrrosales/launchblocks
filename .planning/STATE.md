## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 4 phases derived from 16 requirements, bottom-up through the pipeline dependency graph
- Roadmap: Branding rename confirmed out of scope (LaunchBlocks IS the brand)
- Roadmap: Test infrastructure (Vitest, execa) setup is part of Phase 4, not a separate phase

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flagged node-sql-parser's coverage of Supabase-specific DDL (RLS policies, SECURITY DEFINER) as MEDIUM confidence -- may need pg-query-parser fallback in Phase 3
- Research recommends Node.js engine bump from >=18 to >=20 (18 is EOL) as prerequisite for Vitest 4 + Biome 2 -- decision needed in Phase 1 planning
