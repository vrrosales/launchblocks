Read `LaunchBlocks_implementation.md` in this directory. It is the complete specification for this project.

Implement all 7 modules in the order specified (Module 1 through Module 7).
Use the SQL files in `schemas/migrations/` directly — they are ready to run in Supabase.
Refer to `specs/` for detailed module specifications beyond what LaunchBlocks_implementation.md covers.
Refer to `references/` for implementation patterns and pricing data.
The `launchblocks.config.yaml` file contains the project configuration — do not modify it.
